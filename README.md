# commie

Commie is a simple git commit wrapper that helps with [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

When you run commie, it will look at the branch name and attempt to work out a sensible commit title. You have the option to override this with alternative prefixes like `test`, `docs`, `chore` etc
